    "The Ebola dataset that we had to handle was a very noisy dataset. The dataset consists of CSV files, referring to different countries and different dates of the virus spread. The data itself is records for specific towns of each country describing cases,deaths,etc. and our objective is to find the mean value of new cases and deaths per day for each month. Due to the dirty nature of the dataset we had to implement some data wrangling techniques. The problems which have been observed vary. NaN values or fields with no records,inconsistent values between totals and factors of the totals, similar/identical csv files for different days records, redundant records as far as the mean of new cases and deaths concern, lack of sufficient data for each month (e.g 5 daysreport/month),different descriptions over the records referring to same situations, long representation of the data-unhierarchical representation. We tried to solve most of them in an efficient way (imputation,reshaping,pivoting,aggregations...) and for that reason we did some assumptions over the data."

So we assume that these CSV files correspond to the same report but there was a mistake during the formation of the dataset, because we believe that is impossible two reports of two different days, sometimes even with a 1-day difference to have the same values and features for all the fields. Some examples are (2014-09-07 & 2014-09-08 or 2014-09-16 & 2014/09/17) on Guinea dataset. Our goal is to find these kind of CSV files checking tuples of succesively CSV files."
