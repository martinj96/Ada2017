    "We started by analyzing the html page and locating the data that we need i.e the ranking, country and region, total and international academic stuff, as well as total and international number of students. As mentioned in the homework description the information about the number of staff and students is located in a page other than the one that provides the rank ordering. A redirection to that page is provided by a link on the name of the university and is provided by the root/default/home url suffixed with \"/university/some-format-of-the-university-name\". Our next task is finding a way to collect the data. \n",

    "In order to discover the way the webpage fetches the data we used postman with its interceptor extension, which enabeled us to monitor the requests generated upon every navigation to the given web page. In particular we learned that the data in our interest is returned from an API with a get request to the *data_url* (used in the cell below) in json format. After inspecting the response json object, it has been noticed that all the data displayed on the rankings page originates precisely from this source, and is available in a convinient format. Even more a link to the individual webpage for every university is available, which gives us a way to collect the rest of the data we need. That data though has to be collected by crawling the html response."
