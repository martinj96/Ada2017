    "The Ebola dataset that we had to handle was a very noisy dataset. The dataset consists of CSV files, referring to different countries and different dates of the virus spread. The data itself is records for specific towns of each country describing cases,deaths,etc. and our objective is to find the mean value of new cases and deaths per day for each month. Due to the dirty nature of the dataset we had to implement some data wrangling techniques. The problems which have been observed vary. NaN values or fields with no records,inconsistent values between totals and factors of the totals, similar/identical csv files for different days records, redundant records as far as the mean of new cases and deaths concern, lack of sufficient data for each month (e.g 5 daysreport/month),different descriptions over the records referring to same situations, long representation of the data-unhierarchical representation. We tried to solve most of them in an efficient way (imputation,reshaping,pivoting,aggregations...) and for that reason we did some assumptions over the data."

So we assume that these CSV files correspond to the same report but there was a mistake during the formation of the dataset, because we believe that is impossible two reports of two different days, sometimes even with a 1-day difference to have the same values and features for all the fields. Some examples are (2014-09-07 & 2014-09-08 or 2014-09-16 & 2014/09/17) on Guinea dataset. Our goal is to find these kind of CSV files checking tuples of succesively CSV files."

    "I should mention that as we saw above, there are missing values in the embarkation port and the age. In the former  there are only two missing values and even though they can be easily predicted using some of the others attributes, they are a tiny fraction and can be excluded from the counting. Age on the other hand is missing 263 values, which is a significant fraction. In order to make the most of the information at hand (age can be a significant factor of the survival rate), we could use different prediction techniques to either get the precise age of the individual or just his age category, but as discussed in the exercise session we will just exclude them for the task at hand."

After getting the subset of survivors from the original dataframe, they need to be grouped first by travel class and then by sex (or vice-versa, we'll end up with the same result), count the number of rows in each group and then just do a simple projection of the needed attributes: `pclass`, `sex`, `survived`. The `survived` field now contains the number of rows for each combination of `(pclass, sex)`.\n",

Then we simply divide the values of survived with the values obtained for the total number of passengers per group to obtain a value in the interval [0,1] where 0 means there were no survivors for that particular `(pclass,sex)` combination and 1 if everyone survived."
